The solution lies in understanding CSS specificity and adjusting the rules accordingly.  Here are a few approaches to fix the issue:

1. **Increase Specificity of the intended rule:** If you want the `<p>` elements to be red even when nested in a `<div>`, increase the specificity of the `p { color: red; }` rule. This can be done by adding an ID or a more specific class.

2. **Use !important (Avoid if possible):** As a last resort and generally discouraged, you can use the `!important` flag. However, overuse of `!important` can make your CSS harder to maintain.

3. **Order of rules:** Consider carefully how CSS specificity works and rearrange the order of the rules to ensure the desired style takes precedence.

Here's a possible solution using the first approach:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
div p {
  color: blue;
}

.red-paragraph {
  color: red;
}
p {
  color: green;
}
div {
  color: green;
}
```

Now, by applying the class `red-paragraph` to the `<p>` element, the rule targeting that specific class will override other rules making the text red.
